The entire file including assets was huge, and even after compression it remained a lot bigger than the file size limit, and therefore it could not be uploaded in its entirity.
The key scripts associated with the file have been uploaded in the scripts folder.
An APK in compressed file format has been uploaded in the form of a google drive link in the devpost submission, and it can be run on android. It can work on an emulator as well.
The apk must be downloaded on an android mobile device, extracted, and installed, for it to run successfully.
